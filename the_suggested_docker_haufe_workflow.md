# The Haufe Docker Workflow

Haufe-Lexware recommends learning Docker by beginning to create images via a Dockerfile. W We said that the basic workflow both for learning docker and for implementing docker is:
* Dockerfile
* Image
* Container
* Docker Compose
* Docker Swarm 

For learning purposes it makes sense to start with the Dockerfile, let's take a look and the Huafe definition of a Docker image.

"Docker images are the result of using docker build with a Dockerfile." 

Why start with the docker file, if you can pull and configure images, run containers, compose and everything else without a Dockerfile. Well, to figure out what you want in your Docker process you have to do that anyway. But, the Dockerfile is the artifact that you need to  automate deploying containerized processes. If you want to get serious with docker and use it in production, you must learn how to create good docker files.
