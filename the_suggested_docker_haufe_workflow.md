# The Haufe Docker Workflow

Haufe-Lexware recommends learning Docker by beginning to create images via a Dockerfile. We said that the basic workflow both for learning docker and for implementing docker is:
* Dockerfile
* Image
* Container
* Docker Compose
* Docker Swarm 

For learning purposes it makes sense to start with the Dockerfile simply because in the development and production environments you almost always place Dockerfiles in your build pipelines to deploy your application infrastructure.
