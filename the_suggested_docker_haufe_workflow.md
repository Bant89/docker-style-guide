# The Haufe Docker Workflow

Haufe-Lexware recommends learning Docker by beginning to create images via a Dockerfile. W We said that the basic workflow both for learning docker and for implementing docker is:
* Dockerfile
* Image
* Container
* Docker Compose
* Docker Swarm 

For learning purposes it makes sense to start with the Dockerfile. Once you start putting docke images into the development and production pipelines, you almost will always use Dockerfiles in your build to deploy your application environment using docker.
