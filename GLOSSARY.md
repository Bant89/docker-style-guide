# Glossary

**Docker Principles**: Docker principles are essentially what we want to use Docker and Docker tooling for at Haufe Group. Using Docker for packaging and orchestration of software is one of our Docker principles. Docker principles can be implemented in different ways depending on the context of use. How we implement these principles are Docker practices. There are not too many of these.

**Docker Practices**: Docker practices are the concrete implementations of our Docker Principles and other low-level technical Docker practices to ensure security and so on. An example of a Docker practices is that no secrets are allowed in Dockerfile.

**Section Targets**: Section targets are learning targets placed at the end of each section in the book. These targets show you what you will have learned if you read and work through the linked documentation. Using these targets you can reflect on whether or not you've learned enough or if you should go back and do some more.
