# Why does Haufe need it's own docker book

I don't really know if it's fair to call this a book. I think it's probably better to call it a Docker frame or  something similar. Fact is, there is a lot of Docker documentation out on the net and also some official Haufe documentation - like our Docker Style Guide. So, the purpose of this "Docker frame" is to frame useful content for Haufe developers, release engineers, runtime operators, and anyone else like you, who are going to use docker on a regular basis into a relevant context. 

This context should provide you with things like: 
* A human-readable organization, so you can find docker knowledge that you must have fast(er)
* Recommendations on how you should learn docker for working at Haufe
* Cool links to Docker documentation that fits to what you are doing with Docker
* Some Haufe-unique tips on how to do stuff like get around our fantastic firewall and proxy server

Hopefully, the Haufe Docker book can provide you with a good frame of reference to get started with docker and help you progress up to automatically building and deploying composed, scalable, dockerized applications over continuous delivery pipelines for development purposes here at Haufe Group. It will take a while to put all of the information into this frame, and we, the folks who collaborate on this project, welcome your feedback over all channels, so we can make the information here better over time. 


## Organization: Frame of reference
This book is designed to help Haufe Group employees get started using docker. The organization is taken from the "Next Best Action" project, where non-engineer employees were asked to create a small application in Docker. 

In the first part of the book, the organization is designed, for employees, who have no experience with Docker and, who may not work regularly at developing software. The Second part of the book, let's say from Docker Compose on-wards, gets into concepts that need to be supported by software developers. Keeping that in mind, and the fact that this book is really a framework


## How to use the Docker book
Our CTO asked me to create a rolling narrative for this book, meaning, that the book should provide a continuous story line for learning docker. Since Docker has already been documented extremely well in other parts of the internet, much of this book is designed to point you to these links, so you can read about concepts and tutorials. After that you can come back to this book to continue with the next step of working with docker. 

To put it in plain English, the proposed way to use this book is to read the book, follow the links, learn the concept or do the tutorial (you can of course keep going), but then come back to the book to move further. The book links not only official Docker docs but also other documentation and Haufe Docker documentation that contains requirements for using Docker in production at Haufe. You will also want to bookmark these links so you can access them when working on tutorials and, later, developing your Dockerized apps.

But, you also need to read the content of the book too. This Docker book contains previously undocumented information like how to work from behind of the Haufe Group proxy server or to understand why we want to use docker at Haufe Group. Maybe not so much information as in an O'Reilly media book, but still important if you want to use Docker at Haufe
