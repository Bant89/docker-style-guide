Introduction
============

These guidelines provide rules, best practices, resources and our take on using Docker at Haufe.

__Docker is a fast paced - and new - technology, so Docker itself and theses guidelines are most likely to change.__

Like it's said in other places: We love feedback â€“ you give us
your five cents on the topics we address or tip us in directions we didn't cover.

The [Guidelines](./Guidelines/Guidelines.md) are the most important part!

:bulb: Please contribute!
