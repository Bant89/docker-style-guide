# Why does Haufe need it's own docker book

I don't really know if it's fair to call this a book. I think it's probably better to call it a frame or  something similar. Fact is, there is a lot of Docker documentation out on the net and also some official Haufe documentation - like our Docker Style Guide. So, the purpose of this "Docker frame" is to frame useful content for Haufe developers, like you, who are going to have use docker on a regular basis into a relevant context. 

This context should provide you with things like: 
* A human-readable organization, so you can find docker knowledge that you must have fast
* Recommendation on how you should learn docker
* Cool links to Docker documentation that fits to what you are doing with Docker here at Haufe
* Some Haufe-unique tips on how to do stuff like get around our fantastic firewall and proxy server

Hopefully, the Haufe Docker book can provide you with a good frame of reference to get started with docker and help you progress up to automatically employing composed, scalable, dockerized application environments over continuous delivery pipelines. It will take a while to get put all of the information into this frame, and we, the people who are collaborting on this project welcome your feedback over all channels, so we can make the information here better over time.
