# Docker file structure
There are generally the following sections: 
* Image configuration 
* Container entrypoint
* Container bash

Let's take a look at a Dockerfile with all three sections. The section names are intuitive

## Image configuration
With this part you configure your image. The parts of  your Docker image that your configure here are:
* FROM - your base image that you found in the last section
* 


## Container entrypoint

## Container bash
