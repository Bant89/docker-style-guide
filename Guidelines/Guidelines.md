#Guidelines

## Summary
These folder(s) contain rules and restrictions, that are to be expected "official" ones.

It stands to reason that there will be manual or automatic processes/workflows/reviews/checks that would reject your Docker-artifacts.

> :bulb: If you find something more a hindrance than helpfull, give us a hint and your reasoning.

Even if the guidelines are "official", they're not written in stone and can be modified.

> :bangbang: But don't ignore them on a whim (like: "I just know it better..."), maybe we didn't get the point across properly and you even might agree with us otherwise.

Certainly, if we are wrong, it would be wise to give everybody (including us!) the chance to make and know it better.
