# The Basics - How Docker Works

Docker has a growing tool set that you will need to learn how to use. Some of the stuff we just said above is repeated here but a good explanation of how docker works can be found at [Understanding Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/).
While there are many docker tools out there now, the official Haufe toolset is:
* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker#what-is-docker-engine)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)
* [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/)

You can find many of the best descriptions for how docker works on the Docker Docs website. There are also many good tutorials and definitions on the web. For example, the first tutorial I did was [this one](https://rominirani.com/docker-tutorial-series-a7e6ff90a023#.7rvua5z1m).  This tutorial is a little bit old but it's especially good for learning the docker functionality via the docker command line tool as well as some other basics.
