# The Basics - How Docker Works

Docker has a growing tool set that you will need to learn how to use. Some of the stuff we just said above is repeated here but a good explanation of how docker works can be found at [Understanding Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/).
While there are many docker tools out there now, the official Haufe toolset is:
* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker#what-is-docker-engine)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)
* [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/)
* [Docker Registries](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/#docker-registries)

You can find many of the best descriptions for how docker works on the Docker Docs website.
