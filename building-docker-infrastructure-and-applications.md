# Build Docker Images
This title may also change in the future as Haufe Group incorporates more of docker into its builds. Currently, Haufe only supports a build process for docker images. This build pipeline pushes newly made images into the Huafe Docker Registry. 

The pipeline has four different steps.
* Dockerfile is added to project
* Project is added to the Source Repository
* Project is built from source and and added to the haufe registry haufe.docker.io

## Source
