# Composing applications with Docker Compose

Composing is exactly what you do with docker compose. While it's possible to create an application from a single docker image, when you think about docker's purpose - to serve as a packaging system for our software applications and also how docker "packages" these applications - creating a full-blown application on one image requires more work than creating many base images and configuring them to work together. Docker-Compose enables you to configure and run multi-container applications. 

 Docker Compose also provides you with an easy way to isolate different application environments from one another and even to use variables within the docker-compose.yml file. 

Get started by going through Docker's [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)
